Sample 1:       A generic residential exchange. Few carriers. Note the faint
                pattern from 6900-7400.

Sample 2:       A split exchange. 0-4000 is residential, business from
                4000-9999.

Sample 3:       A double exposure, this is a merge of a tone and carrier
                scan. A dozen odd PBX's are sandwiched between residential
                or mixed use. Note the tones and carriers at the bottom of
                the PBX DID ranges.

Sample 4:       Another mixed exchange, this time with wider bands. The
                voice ranges are unworking numbers. The busy bands are
                unused numbers in commercial DID groups.

Sample 5:       This is much like sample 4, but with a more typical blurring
                of boundaries between bands.

Sample 6 & 7:   More mixed exchanges, with even less distinction between
                bands. Here hunt and DID groups do not fill even bands of
                100. This one comes from a large city where phone numbers
                are at a premium.

Sample 8a & 8b: This is the same exchange scanned twice, first for tones,
                then for carriers. They look very different. Can someone
                explain the "grid" pattern in the carrier scan 8000-9999?

Sample 9:       Tone scanning doesn't always work well, even with the right
                kind of modem. Any real tones are here obscured by false
                responses.

Sample 10:      Here's an exchange with many carriers. This is what carrier
                logging is for.

Sample 11:      An exchange with many carriers in one band.

Sample 12:      Notice how this exchange fades off towards the bottom in
                places. We've seen this a lot; perhaps low numbers are
                allocated first?
